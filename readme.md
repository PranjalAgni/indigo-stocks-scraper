# Indigo-Stocks-Scraper

I came to know from Indigo customer care, that flight prices usually go down as the stock price Indigo go down. So I wrote a simple automation script, that notifies me when the price go down below a set threshold price.

Currently all the price gets dumped in a log file.

## Note - This automation uses web scraping to get the current stock price, so it might break as the html elements ids/classes changes.
